To Do: 

Display city data
Handle data for 2 objects: 
	- Forcast (3 day, rough)

Create DOM handling funcs to: 
	- create divs for current & forcast
	- Why double div to start??!!
	- Fix so either: 
		- Re-populates existing divs is already created
		OR 
		- Erases and recreates divs with new results. 
	- erase if no results or new data

Once have a working app: 
	- create webpack structure
	- create modules and bundlle functions
	- make dist folder for export and prod.
